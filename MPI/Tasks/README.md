# MPI's Tasks

1. [Calculate Sum of Array Elements](https://github.com/goodluck3301/computer-since/blob/main/MPI/Tasks/sum.c "sum.c")

> 

2. [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/goodluck3301/computer-since/blob/main/MPI/Tasks/bubble_sort.c "bubble_sort.c")

> Sorting array of 50000 size using bubble sort algorithm

3.  [The Coupon Collector's Problem](https://github.com/goodluck3301/computer-since/blob/main/MPI/Tasks/Coupon_Collectors.c "Coupon_Collectors.c")

> This is a problem that asks how many random draws from a set of n distinct coupons are needed on average to collect all n coupons at least once. The answer is not intuitive, and it depends on the value of n. For example, if n=10, then on average, it takes about 34 draws to collect all the coupons.
